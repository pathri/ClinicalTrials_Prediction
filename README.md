# CompoundDb4jML



This repo contains the source code for "Machine learning and bioinformatics models to predict the success of clinical trial with an integrated drug resource"

Artifacts:
Data Integration of multiple hetergenous chemical databases to Neo4j
These databases are DrugBank, ChEMBL, CTD, NDFRT, UniProt Pubchem and USPTO
write on databases that we integrated to neo4j 

Inhouse curated data extraction from the integrated data source, centered around ClinicalTrials, Compounds, Diseases and Targets

Machine learning based prediction model for predicting the success of clinical trial
    Feature extraction for ML
    Model Training, paramter tuning with supervised algorithms and performance measures
