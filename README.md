# CompoundDb4jML



This repo contains the source code for "Machine learning and bioinformatics models to predict the success of clinical trial with an integrated drug resource"

Artifacts:
    Data Integration of multiple heterogenous chemical databases to Neo4j
    These databases are DrugBank, ChEMBL, CTD, NDFRT, UniProt Pubchem and USPTO

DataFusion: 
    Mapping across database and within a database 

Machine learning:
    Inhouse curated data extraction from the integrated data source, centered around ClinicalTrials, Compounds, Diseases and Targets
    Feature extraction for ML
    Model Training, paramter tuning with supervised algorithms and performance measures
